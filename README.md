**********************************************************

*Frameworks used:*

### The Client
Angular JS  - Front end MVC.
	Everything is injected in, which means there is low coupling of dependencies. Additionally, Angular has a great separation between views, models and controllers.

React JS - Front end dynamic UI rendering.
	Since, there exists large UI rendering on dynamic data change, React JS is perfect
	to maintain the change of the required data only instead of the whole page render.

### The Server
Node JS - Back end API creation.

Description : The application intends to create a dashboard having multiple tabs. On selection of each tabs, the user is provided with a view in respective to the corresponding tab.

Currently aiming to create the following tabs: 
	1. Dynamic data change from API is reflected onto the view.
	2. Chat application using Node JS.
